                <p>The movie is entirely based on actions and consequences. It doesn’t portray anybody as evil or good. It shows them as they are, and I like how it isn’t black and white like most movies are.</p>

                    Well, maybe I have more than five words. What if someone from the past could call you over the phone?  Would you pick up? Should you? What if that one decision could change everything?
                    
                    Well, I can't say more because I want you to experience it for yourself.</p>

                <p>Despite being Kollywood’s 70-year dream project, there were complaints that the movie is nothing like the book. But I think that’s exactly where its strength lies. It’s got a ton of characters, which can be hard to keep track of. The movie helps by introducing them visually, so when you read the book, it’s easier to follow—while still preserving the plot.</p>
